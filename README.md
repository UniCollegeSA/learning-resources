# Learning Resources

This is a list of publicly available learning resources. Most are free but some might required payment. I will add a note if it is a paid resource saying so. 

*Warning: These learning resources are great and all, but be careful not to fall in what people call "Tutorial Hell". It is where you're stuck on just learning tutorials, used to the hand holding and comfort of just following a tutorial.
To break free from Tutorial Hell you must actually try to build projects on your own. Free from the comfortable environment that a tutorial provides. 

## Computer Science

- **CS50x** ([https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/))

## Web Development Overall (Frontend & Backend)

- **MDN Web Docs** ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/))

  MDN is quite theory and knowledge heavy, requires a lot of reading. Note that there are pracitce sections at well at the bottom of many pages. So they do practicly apply it as well. 
  Theory is also very important at understanding the technologies at its core. Which will make you a really good programmer overall and better than many who don't do the effort to dig deeper.
  
- **W3 Schools** ([https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/))

  W3 Schools is also quite reading heavy in the reference and tutorial sections. But they do have practice sections as well which gets your hands on the keyboard.
  W3 Schools also has references and tutorials for many other technologies as well. For Front-End, Back-End, etc.
  
- **FreeCodeCamp** ([https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn))

## Recommended Udemy Courses

  Never pay full price for a Udemy course. Always wait for it to go on special. It will.

- **Academind** ([https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/))

  Basically any course by Academind or Maximilian Schwarzmüller. They also have their own website, [https://academind.com/courses](https://academind.com/courses), where you can check out all their courses, there's also articles on there from which you can learn as well.
  I believe also that if you go through their website to the Udemy course a coupon code will be applied to get you a discount.
